    <!-- 
        This heading shows which job type the interview is for.
        The {{ job_type }} comes from app.py, where you passed it from the form on index.html.
        Example: "Interview for Data Science"
    -->
    <h2>Interview for {{ job_type }}</h2>

    <!-- 
        This form collects answers to each question.
        When you click "Submit Answers", the data will be sent (POST) to the '/feedback' route in app.py
    -->
    <form action="/feedback" method="post">

        <!-- 
            Loop through the list of 4 questions passed in from the backend (app.py).
            Each question will display with a matching textarea input for the user to write an answer.
        -->

            <!-- 
                Show the question text from the questions list.
                Example: "Q1: What is overfitting in machine learning?"
                This is exactly what you said you want as output.
            -->
            <p><strong>Q{{ i + 1 }}:</strong> {{ questions[i] }}</p>

            <!-- 
                Textarea for the user to type their answer for each question.
                Each input has a unique name like answer1, answer2, etc., so Flask can read them later.
            -->
            <textarea name="answer{{ i + 1 }}" rows="4" cols="60" required></textarea><br><br>

            <!-- 
                This hidden input carries the question text along with the form.
                Why? So when Flask receives the answer, it also knows what question it belongs to.
            -->

            Re-send the job type along with the form so it's still available later (for feedback, storage, etc.)
        -->
        <input type="hidden" name="job_type" value="{{ job_type }}">

        <!-- 
            The submit button that sends all answers + questions to the /feedback route.
